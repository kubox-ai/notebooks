> [!TIP]
> Kubox is currently in its early-stage public preview and under active development. Weâ€™re continuously improving and refining the platform, so things may change as we grow. We welcome your feedback and suggestions to help shape the future of kubox ai.

## AWS Cloud Setup

Create an [AWS IAM role](https://docs.kubox.ai/kb/advance-config#role-for-kubox-ec2-instances) for the EC2 Instances

If you are creating a GPU based kubox cluster outside ap-southeast-2, you will need to [create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://docs.kubox.ai/kb/advance-config#creating-gpu-amazon-machine-image-ami) in your desired AWS region

Download and install `kuboxctl` a is a single binary required to create a Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
curl https://kubox.sh | sh
```

Setup AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please ensure the aws region set during the aws configure and the cluster.yaml is the same.

## Running kubox notebooks in a kubox cluster

Clone the kubox notebooks repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubox-ai/notebooks.git
```

Create a kubox cluster from the root of the cloned repository:

```bash
kuboxctl create -f cluster-basic.yaml
```

If you have issues creating see the troubleshooting guide here:
https://docs.kubox.ai/kb/troubleshooting

A kubeconfig file will be generated as part of the cluster creation process. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./basic/cluster/config/kubeconfig
```

Connect to the kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kubox
```

Port forward the notebook server to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/notebook 8080:80 -n kubox
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

Delete the cluster when done.

```bash
kuboxctl delete -f cluster-basic.yaml
```

## Local Development

Navigate to the basic or gpu directory

```bash
cd ./basic
```

Create a local python virtual environment and activate it. We are using `pyenv` to manage our python versions. You can use `pyenv install` to install a python version.

Set the current python version to 3.11.9

```bash
pyenv shell 3.11.9
```

Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install poetry

```bash
cd code
pip install poetry
```

Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```
